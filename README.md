scriptella-vtdxml
=================

This is an implementation of vtd-xml as xpath driver for scriptella.

Checkout the test with the large.xml in scriptella.driver.vtdxml.XPathConnectionPerfTest, 
this is what you want to see.

Two great framworks come together.

Usage:
* compile the code and put it on your classpath.
* <code>   \<connection id="xml-input" driver="vtdxml" url="${some_directory}/large.xml"/>  </code>
